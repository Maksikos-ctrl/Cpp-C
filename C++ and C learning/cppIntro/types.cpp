// int x = 10 - means variable x will represent an integer value, e.g 4, 27, 0, -2, or -12
//TODO In C++, the type of a variable must be known at compile-time 

/*

int b = 10,
    a = 20


*/


// identifiers are unique names, like x, y, sum, sumTo



/* 4 ways to initialize vars in C++ 

int a;
int b = 10;

// Direct initialization 
int c(10);  was initially introduced to allow for more efficient initialization of complex objects


// Brace initialization
int d { 10 }; was  use a form of initialization that makes use of curly braces: brace initialization (also called uniform initialization or list initialization).


// Zero initialization

int width {} - zero initialization to value 0, means undefined like in Js

// double x = 10 - is data type that can represent any numerical value in the compiler
