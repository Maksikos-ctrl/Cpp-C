//* There are 4 types of storage class
/* 
  1.  automatic(local) - can be reached and invoked only inside of func or loop, cond where it was declared
  2.  external(global) - can be reached and invoked everywhere in program, they are declared from the begging of the program till the end
  3.  static - declared using "static" keyword, it means, for instance we've added our static var to 5 and got 6 and then when we wanna do it again, we take 6, not 1, 6, cuz it's static and doing += 5 and get 11 
  4.  register - register vars faster than local vars, but onlu in embedded
